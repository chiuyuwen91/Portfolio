- Web-based App  
    + [Data Collection web app](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Data_collection_web_app/blob/main/app.py) ：The Data Collection Web App was aimed at developing a comprehensive web application for gathering and sharing data about households in the United States, with a specific focus on alternative power sources and other household properties. The project followed the three phases of the Database Application Development Methodology: Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation. In the Analysis & Specification phase, the project's requirements and goals were defined, accompanied by the creation of user stories and use cases. The Design phase involved crafting wireframes and mockups for the user interface, finalizing the database schema, and designing the application's architecture and data flow. During the Implementation phase, a Flask (Python web framework) backend was established, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application featured user registration, data submission, and open data collection, allowing anyone to submit their household data and access selected reports on the website. The project's codebase was hosted on GitHub, facilitating collaboration and showcasing expertise in web application development, database management, and user interface design, contributing to the cause of promoting alternative energy sources and sustainable living.
      
- Machine Learning
    + [Sentiment Analysis of Earnings](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Sentiment_analysis_earnings/blob/main/bert_model.py) ：In this work, I replicated the BERT model architecture for financial sentiment analysis by following its two main phases: pretraining and fine-tuning. During pretraining, I used the ECTSum dataset, which consisted of approximately 9,000 earnings call transcripts paired with bullet-point summaries, to equip the model with domain-specific knowledge essential for understanding financial language. The pretraining tasks included Masked Language Modeling (MLM), where 15% of the words in the transcripts were randomly masked, and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), which helped the model capture contextual and structural relationships. I trained two model versions, BERT Base and BERT Large, from scratch and stored checkpoints based on the lowest validation loss. For fine-tuning, I adapted the pretrained models to the Financial PhraseBank dataset using focal loss to address class imbalance, which improved performance on minority classes. This domain-specific approach enabled the model to effectively handle the nuances of financial language and achieve robust sentiment classification.
    + [Evaluating a Stock Price Strategy](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Evaluating_a_Stock_Price_Strategy/blob/main/p8_strategyEval%20_report.pdf) ：Implemented a stock price strategy utilizing technical analysis combined with reinforcement learning techniques. Leveraged advanced algorithms to analyze historical stock data and identify patterns for making informed trading decisions. Integrated reinforcement learning algorithms to continuously refine and optimize the trading strategy based on real-time market conditions. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of both technical analysis and machine learning, showcasing the ability to develop effective trading strategies that adapt and improve over time.
    + [Weather Analysis and Deployment with FastAPI](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/weather) ：This project provides a complete pipeline for collecting, storing, analyzing, and serving weather data via a web API. It integrates PostgreSQL for data storage, Alembic for database migrations, and FastAPI for the REST API. The system supports data ingestion, analysis, and visualization, making it suitable for weather monitoring and trend analysis.
        Key Features:   
        + Data Collection: Stores weather data from multiple stations.
        + Analysis: Generates aggregated weather statistics.
        + API Deployment: Provides a REST API for accessing weather data.
        + AWS Deployment: Uses AWS RDS, ECS Fargate, and ELB for scalability.
    + [Sentiment Analysis of Tripadvisor Reviews](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Portfolio/blob/main/Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20Tripadvisor%20Reviews.ipynb) ：Developed a robust predictive sentiment analysis model in Python, utilizing natural language processing tools. The model accurately anticipates hotel ratings based on customer reviews. Additionally, conducted a comprehensive comparison with logistic regression, gradient boosting classification, and random forest classification models. The models were trained using a large dataset of text reviews collected from Tripadvisor. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of NLP techniques, model evaluation, and leveraging diverse machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from textual data.    
    
      
- Econometrics        
    + [Econometric Analysis of Mental-health effect]( https://chiuyuwen91.github.io/Economics/)         :A project to explore the factors which cause the depression based on multiple linear regression model in R. Trained with the data provided from [Center for Disease Control Prevention.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
