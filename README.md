- Web-based App  
    + [Data Collection web app](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Data_collection_web_app/blob/main/app.py) ：The Data Collection Web App was aimed at developing a comprehensive web application for gathering and sharing data about households in the United States, with a specific focus on alternative power sources and other household properties. The project followed the three phases of the Database Application Development Methodology: Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation. In the Analysis & Specification phase, the project's requirements and goals were defined, accompanied by the creation of user stories and use cases. The Design phase involved crafting wireframes and mockups for the user interface, finalizing the database schema, and designing the application's architecture and data flow. During the Implementation phase, a Flask (Python web framework) backend was established, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application featured user registration, data submission, and open data collection, allowing anyone to submit their household data and access selected reports on the website. The project's codebase was hosted on GitHub, facilitating collaboration and showcasing expertise in web application development, database management, and user interface design, contributing to the cause of promoting alternative energy sources and sustainable living.
      
- Machine Learning  
    + [Evaluating a Stock Price Strategy](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Evaluating_a_Stock_Price_Strategy/blob/main/p8_strategyEval%20_report.pdf) ：Implemented a stock price strategy utilizing technical analysis combined with reinforcement learning techniques. Leveraged advanced algorithms to analyze historical stock data and identify patterns for making informed trading decisions. Integrated reinforcement learning algorithms to continuously refine and optimize the trading strategy based on real-time market conditions. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of both technical analysis and machine learning, showcasing the ability to develop effective trading strategies that adapt and improve over time.
    + [Sentiment Analysis of Tripadvisor Reviews](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Portfolio/blob/main/Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20Tripadvisor%20Reviews.ipynb) ：Developed a robust predictive sentiment analysis model in Python, utilizing natural language processing tools. The model accurately anticipates hotel ratings based on customer reviews. Additionally, conducted a comprehensive comparison with logistic regression, gradient boosting classification, and random forest classification models. The models were trained using a large dataset of text reviews collected from Tripadvisor. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of NLP techniques, model evaluation, and leveraging diverse machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from textual data.    
    + [Exchange Rate Forecast](https://github.com/chiuyuwen91/Exchange_Rate_Forecast_project/blob/master/fine_tune_corr.py) : Developed an exchange rate prediction model using time series analysis methods to forecast the rates between the Taiwanese dollar and US dollar. Leveraged techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or similar time series models to analyze historical exchange rate data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions. This project showcases expertise in time series analysis and the ability to apply it to real-world financial forecasting, enabling better decision-making in the context of currency exchange. 
      
- Econometrics        
    + [Econometric Analysis of Mental-health effect]( https://chiuyuwen91.github.io/Economics/)         :A project to explore the factors which cause the depression based on multiple linear regression model in R. Trained with the data provided from [Center for Disease Control Prevention.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
